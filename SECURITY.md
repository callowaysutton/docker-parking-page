**Repository Security Policy**

1. **Purpose**: 
   - This security policy outlines the guidelines and measures for maintaining security in the repository dedicated to building Docker images for serving static parked domain websites.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Access to this repository is restricted to authorized personnel only.
   - All contributors must authenticate their identity before being granted access.
   - Access privileges are granted based on roles and responsibilities.

3. **Code Review**:
   - All changes to the repository codebase must undergo thorough review before being merged into the main branch.
   - Code reviews ensure adherence to coding standards, security best practices, and compatibility with the intended purpose of the repository.
   - Reviewers must provide feedback and suggestions for improvement, addressing any potential security vulnerabilities or code quality issues.

4. **Dependency Management**:
   - Dependencies and third-party libraries used in the Docker image must be vetted for security vulnerabilities.
   - Regular dependency scans should be conducted to identify and mitigate any known vulnerabilities.
   - Dependencies should be kept up-to-date to leverage security patches and enhancements.

5. **Dockerfile Security**:
   - The Dockerfile used for building the Docker image must follow security best practices.
   - Only necessary packages and components should be included in the Docker image to minimize attack surface.
   - Image layers should be minimized to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities and improve efficiency.
   - Official and trusted base images should be used as the foundation for the Docker image.

6. **Image Scanning**:
   - Docker images built from this repository should undergo vulnerability scanning before deployment.
   - Image scanning tools should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect and address vulnerabilities.
   - Vulnerabilities identified during scanning should be promptly remediated or mitigated.

7. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Access to the Docker image registry and deployment environments should be protected by strong authentication mechanisms.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) should be implemented to restrict access to authorized users and roles.
   - Credentials, secrets, and sensitive information used in the deployment process should be securely managed and protected.

8. **Incident Response**:
   - Procedures and protocols for responding to security incidents should be documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders.
   - An incident response team should be designated to handle security incidents promptly and effectively.
   - Post-incident reviews should be conducted to identify lessons learned and improve security posture.

9. **Compliance and Regulations**:
   - This security policy should align with relevant regulatory requirements, industry standards, and organizational policies.
   - Compliance checks should be performed periodically to ensure adherence to applicable security standards.

10. **Continuous Improvement**:
    - Security practices and measures should be continuously evaluated and improved to adapt to evolving threats and challenges.
    - Feedback from security assessments, audits, and incident response activities should be used to refine security processes and controls.

**Note**: This security policy serves as a baseline and may be customized or expanded based on specific organizational requirements, compliance obligations, and risk factors associated with the repository and its operations.
